    <h3>Write For Us</h3>

    <p>If you have an idea for an article or tutorial, we’d love to hear about it!</p>
    <p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong> We pay great rates for all content that gets approved and published ($100 – $400*)… we’ll even post a link to your site, an image of you, and a short bio. If good karma, good money, and good exposure aren’t enough to tempt you, we don’t know what is!</p>

    <p>We’ll even help promote your products if you’re an author on one of the Envato marketplaces!</p>
    <p><em>* Payment rates depend on the topic, depth, quality, and type of content; For example: complete design tutorials pay more than short articles, and we’ll gladly let you know what how much we can offer for your idea if you pitch it to us.</em><p>
