      name: "You're taking risks for beauty's sake"
      recommendation: "Don't let your beauty turn beastly: You appear to be taking some risks when it comes to being beautiful that may be compromising your health. The most important way to prevent damaging your body is to thoroughly check out who performs your beauty procedures-whether it's tattooing, hair styling, cosmetic surgery, or skin care-before you do them. Never get an invasive medical procedure from anyone other than a licensed medical doctor. You are responsible for your health, and you look your best when you are healthy, well-rested, and maintain a well-balanced diet. No beauty procedure can take the place of those things."

      name: "Don't cut corners when it comes to your beauty routines."
      recommendation: "It is probably too good to be true: You may be taking unnecessary risks to be beautiful. Though you know enough not to get invasive procedures done by anyone other than a licensed physician is dangerous, you have been known to cut corners for some beauty procedures. When it comes to do it yourself beauty routines, never rely on claims made solely on the internet. Ask your dermatologist whether a certain item is safe to use on your hair, skin or nails. Though there are tons of websites selling fashion contact lenses, which can make your eyes look (temporarily) any color of the rainbow, improper use can lead to corneal abrasions and infections. Ask yourself, Is it worth the risk, just for one night of beauty?"

    quiz_recommendation_2:
      name: "Beauty comes from within"
      recommendation: "You put your health before your looks: Good for you! You know that in order to look good, you have to feel good. And that includes not endangering your health all for the sake of beauty. You check out salons before getting your nails done, making sure the establishment is clean with equipment that is sterilized after each customer. Even better, you bring your own manicure tools. You don't allow any cutting of your cuticles, as this can introduce fungal infections. You check the expiration dates of your makeup, tossing old, expired products that may have picked up bacteria. You never share your makeup with anyone. As far as beauty procedures, you know to check references of anyone doing the work to make sure they are licensed. Finally, there is no such thing as a bargain when it comes to keeping you healthy and feeling good."
