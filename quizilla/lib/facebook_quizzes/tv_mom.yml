      name: "Everybody loves Raymond but you are Debra Barone - the woman behind it all"
      recommendation: "You are Debra Barone: Everybody may love Raymond, but it's you - Debra Barone - who deserves all the credit. You're a stay-at-home mom who can make three different kinds of PB&J sandwiches with one hand, while holding a crying baby in the other. Like Annie Camden on \"Seventh Heaven,\" you have made sacrifices to stay home with your kids, but you know how quickly this time goes and you want to savor it. You have all of the responsibility, but get none of the fame... and you love every moment of it."

Just like Maggie Seaver on \"Growing Pains\", you have found a perfect balance between meeting your family's needs while climbing the corporate ladder. Your Smartphone is your best friend, and you've managed your family affairs as well as any deal you've closed."

Just like Angela Bower, you're \"the boss\" both at home and at work. Though you may not have a male nanny like Tony or sing in a band with your kids like Shirley on the \"Partridge Family,\" you're redefining the traditional family, and finding out that being independent isn't so bad."

You're now a stay-at-home mom to a blended family, the result of marrying a man with kids after your divorce or being widowed. Your house has gotten much louder! But you are reveling in your family life. You're managing the needs of many kids with a wide age range, some still young and some growing into adulthood. You like being at home, managing the kids' day-to-day schedules and refereeing the occasional disagreement that comes from sibling rivalry. While most of your neighbors have both parents working, you feel no pressure to do so, as the kids keep you so busy and you think it gives them some stability in this new living situation."
