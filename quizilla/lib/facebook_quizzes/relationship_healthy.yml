      name: "You're taking care of your relationship"
      recommendation: "Your long-term prognosis looks good! You seem to be in a healthy, loving relationship built on mutual admiration, support, and honesty. Not everyone is so lucky, but you know that it's not all luck, either. You understand that successful relationships are built on mutual admiration and genuine appreciation for each other. It also takes hard work to be honest and supportive. People are constantly evolving, and that&rsquo;s why it's important to maintain an open and honest communication. Remember to genuinely listen to what your partner is saying. Be mindful of each other's needs so you could continue to grow together. Don't plan what you're going to reply or interrupt while he is speaking. Ask him questions, to make sure you've gotten what he is truly saying and to keep the communication flowing. Listen with your eyes as well as your ears, as body language can speak volumes. By keeping the lines of communication open, you can continue to enjoy a happy relationship that meets both your needs."

      name: Your relationship needs preventive care
      recommendation: "You need checkups for a healthy relationship: You seem to be in a good relationship-one that meets your and your partner's emotional needs. But, like other relationships, there may be some areas which need to be worked on to make you guys a better couple. The most important thing to bear in mind when assessing your relationship is that only YOU are responsible for your happiness. Too often, relationships fail because someone is unhappy and blames the partner. Do not expect your partner to agree with you on every issue. Reach a mutual agreement or plan, and then commit to it. Keeping agreements shows respect for yourself and your partner, as well as creating a sense of trust and safety. Use communication to establish a common ground to understand different points of view. Having a healthy relationship means that, while you have your experience, and your partner has his or her experience, you love and share and learn from those experiences together."

      name: Your relationship needs emergency care
      recommendation: "Call 9-1-1! Your relationship needs help! Everyone has the right to a healthy relationship-one in which both people feel a healthy sense of \"self.\" But it seems that your relationship may include criticism, negativity, not meeting one another's emotional needs. You should have a frank discussion with your partner to see if you should continue with the relationship. The first thing to try to improve your situation is to speak up when something is bothering you. It takes compromise and sacrifice to make any relationship work, but you should also ask yourself whether all the compromise and sacrifice you&rsquo;ve made actually threaten your sense of self as an individual. Work together when making decisions on home, friendships, money, and career. Be thoughtful and appreciate all the good qualities that attracted you to your partner in the first place. Ask yourself if you are in the relationship for the right reasons. Do you feel loved and appreciated in your relationship? Nobody knows your relationship better than you do, so look deep inside and try to understand the root of the problem. Are both of you willing to make the same commitment and effort to make things work?"
