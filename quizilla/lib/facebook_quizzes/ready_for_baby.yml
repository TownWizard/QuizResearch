      recommendation: "Congratulations! You are ready to have a baby: You have baby on your mind and you're on the fast track to parenthood. You seem to be mentally and emotionally ready for an addition to you life. Before you take that big step, you should consider the following things. Make a visit with your doctor and tell him or her that you and your partner are ready to try for a baby. The doctor will check things out and either give you the green light or might tell you some health concerns you can address-whether it's losing some weight or getting your vitamin levels up-to optimize your chances for an easy pregnancy and a healthy baby. You should make sure you and your partner are in agreement with the big changes about to come into your lives. Keep an open dialogue on things like finances, going back to work, childcare, raising your child in a particular religion, etc., to minimize conflict after the baby arrives. You are about to embark on one of the most rewarding-and stressful-experiences of a lifetime. Congratulations!"

      name: "Having a baby is a long-term goal"
      recommendation: "Having a baby is on your radar: Congratulations on knowing yourself and taking a slow approach to parenthood. Too many people rush into it before they  are ready-physically, financially, emotionally-and feel overwhelmed and miserable during the first weeks and months with a demanding newborn. You know how important it is to discuss things such as budget, childcare and other work-related expenses in order to determine whether it would be feasible for one parent to stay at home with the new baby. In addition, you need to consider the emotional demands. New parents need to be able to tolerate the demands of a baby, plus the stress that lack of sleep and around-the-clock care places on an individual. Finally, you are smart to give yourself time to get your body in optimal condition to take on the physical demands of pregnancy and the hard work that comes caring for a newborn. You are on the right track to making this important life decision."

      name: "It's not the right time to have a baby"
      recommendation: "You have other priorities than a baby: You know that you're not ready to have a baby. Good for you! With all the romanticized images of children and parenthood floating around, it's easy to get an idealized, rather than a realistic, view of what it's like to be a parent. Too many people rush into parenthood without considering all the changes in their lifestyle, and as a result, feel stressed and trapped when the baby arrives. Don't let anyone talk you into being a parent before you're ready. And it's possible you'll never be ready! Parenthood is not for everyone.  It may be for some people but not for all.  Avoid feeling the family pressures and live your own life."
