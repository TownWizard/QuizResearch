      name: You are a workaholic!
      recommendation: "You live to work: You love your job, but maybe too much. Most people have to work, and it's a bonus if you love what you do. But there is more to life than your career. Family, friends and relationships matter, too, and if you find that you have no time for nurturing these relationships, it's time to step back and take an inventory of what's important. Yes, your livelihood depends on earning a salary from work, but ask yourself if you're working too much for the wrong reasons. Sometimes people use work as an excuse to keep them from developing deeper relationships with family and friends or to avoid conflict at home. You could benefit from developing interests outside of work, like volunteering, in which you can get a great feeling of personal satisfaction that has nothing to do with earning money or impressing the boss. You could also take up a hobby or try a relaxing exercise program, like yoga. You will find that centering your breathing and your body can lead to \"centering\" of your work and home lives, as well."

    quiz_recommendation_1:
      name: You work to pay the bills
      recommendation: "You work to live: You have a lot going on in your life, and you get much enjoyment out of things. Work for you is a means to an end, but nothing more. You like socializing with your co-workers, but you get fulfillment from your relationships with family and friends and social circle on weekends. That's OK! Everyone can't be a Donald Trump and in fact, you probably don't even like him. What activities do you so look forward to on weekends? Maybe it's visiting with family or volunteering with the homeless.  Maybe you like participating in neighborhood clean-ups. Maybe it's running in the park or running a monthly book club. Ask yourself if there's any way to turn these favorite activities into a job you might love too! Fill out a volunteer application at a local charity. Inquire at a sporting goods store about career paths or consider getting a personal trainer certification. The point is, you may be unsatisfied with your job, but it doesn't mean that you don't like to work at all."

    quiz_recommendation_2:
      name: Your life is in balance
      recommendation: "You balance home and work life beautifully: You seem to have gotten the right balance between being a team player at work and taking the time to nurture yourself and your personal relationships. Good for you! People are constantly being pulled in many directions-work demands, spouse and child needs, aging parents-can get overwhelmed. You have somehow designed your life to make it all work. You do your best at your job without letting it take over your life, while also delegating home responsibilities so it all gets done. Remember to frequently check in with family and friends you haven't spoken to in a while to keep involved in their lives. Try to make time for yourself, whether it's participating in a sport you love or taking a film class at your local library. The more happy and centered you feel, the easier it is to meet the responsibilities of others."
