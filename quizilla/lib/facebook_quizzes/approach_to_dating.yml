      name: "You approach all things sensibly, but you can find more"
      recommendation: "You are Sensible, Safe and Pragmatic: You have a sensible approach to life and how and when to spend your time. You are busy working at the same job for many years with a stable income. At night you go home but occasionally stay after work to go to a local bar to hang out with your co-workers. Consider joining a local book club to expand your personal relationships and find a new favorite author. Let your friends -- both married and single - know that you still feel they are important to you in your life and you don't want too much time to go by without seeing them. You never know when they may have a single friend for you to meet."

      name: "It's traditional love for you"
      recommendation: "Strict - It's your way or the highway: You are quite conservative when it comes to dating, and it's clear you take the more traditional route when it comes to love. So traditional, in fact, that it's more \"old school\" - as in Old World - than modern times permit. There is nothing wrong with holding on to traditional values, but it's okay to seek out men who share your value system in non-traditional venues, such as online dating web sites or speed-dating events at your local house of worship. If it's parental disapproval you are fearing, have a heart-to-heart talk with your mom and dad, perhaps getting a trusted aunt or brother and sister in your court first. Make it clear that, while you respect them and their traditions, you are an adult who has to make her own way in life, and that includes picking a mate."

    quiz_recommendation_2:
      name: "You move away from the comfort zone and get better with time"
      recommendation: "You like a little adventure: You like being a little more adventurous and move away from your comfort zone when seeking individuals who share your beliefs. With a balanced approach to dating, you are far more likely to find the man of your dreams rather than suffer through too many nightmarish dates. Continue to expand your opportunities to meet new people, whether it's through volunteer work or taking evening classes for adults. Even if you don't meet the perfect mate, you will be helping people and learning new skills, which are invaluable. Remember, you'll kiss a lot of frogs before you find that one prince, but once the magic happens, it may just mean a lifetime of happiness."

    quiz_recommendation_3:
      name: "Slow down to find true love"
      recommendation: "Anything Goes Dater: Slow down, sister! Walking too much on the wild side of town is fun for the moment, but those moments are fleeting, and if you are serious about finding a mate  or going on a serious date - you need to realize that downing shots is drowning your chances for finding true love. If you want to change your success rate, change your environment. Stay away from loud, crowded bars and spend more time networking with friends and family to help you on your search. If you have any hobbies, like sports or collecting, join some local groups so you will immediately have one thing in common with other singles in the club. Consider volunteering your time at a local charity. It is a great way to meet people who have strong values and are generous with their time. This is about sending you down the right path towards finding true love rather than stopping at all the honkytonks along the way."
