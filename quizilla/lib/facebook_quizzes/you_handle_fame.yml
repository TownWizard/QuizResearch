      name: In your next life you will be Beyonce Knowles or Sasha Baron Cohen
      recommendation: "You want as much celebrity as possible and will take every advantage that comes with it. You are Paris Hilton, Beyonce Knowles, Madonna and Sasha Baron Cohen rolled into one.You crave attention and will do nearly anything to get it. Not only is every activity a photo-op, you call the paparazzi in advance to tell them where you'll be. You love to be \"caught out shopping\" on Robertson and Rodeo, lunching at the latest LA hotspot, on the beach in the Riviera and/or posing at the latest designer boutique opening. You are not a stranger to embarrassing publicity, but have learned that any and all press is good press. Some might find you to be self-centered and high maintenance, but you know they're just jealous.Luckily, you were born to be a star and take full advantage of the perks. You aim to rule over a boundless empire: gold records, endorsements, commercials, an Oscar, a designer clothing line; you want it all. Over-exposure is not part of your lexicon. Bring the fame and bring the noise.You are purposeful and premeditated in your pursuit of press and notoriety. You constantly reinvent yourself in order to keep the public's interest. You do not shy away from controversy and, frequently, seek it out. You are unapologetic about your choices and do it your own way. Never one to be owned or told what to do, you have created the ultimate brand: yourself.To stay in the spotlight, you will do any stunts to shock your audience, so being in front of the paparazzi in pursuit of a good picture and crazy story that sells to all the tabloids is your main goal. You look forward to the most publicity and subsequent lawsuits. You are currently brainstorming your next MTV type stunt when you are finished with your latest documentary."

      name: You are Meryl Streep and Ed Norton
      recommendation: "You occasionally exploit the perks, but would keep your ego in check! You are Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lopez and Ed Norton rolled into one.A diva, you yearn to be a singular act at all times. Instead of interviews, you primarily express yourself through fashion, flawless make-up and hair. Rumors occasionally proliferate in the tabloids, but you rarely provide a response or acknowledgment. Your interviews and photos come at a price - the sale of your wedding and baby photos to popular magazines and tabloids draws top dollar. Overall, you prefer the glamour to the gossip. Your style is your brand.When you take on a role, you are a chameleon. The way you transform the various characters you portray, you completely nail them all, leaving the audience breathless. You are a good role model for young up and coming actors to follow by honing your craft to the max! None of the other actors want to be up against you in the best actress category because there is no chance. They are still honored to be in the same category as you and in your presence.In the end, you are the new generation of talent following in the footsteps of the great actors of all time and have starred in numerous Hollywood blockbusters. You lead a low key life and do interviews and talk shows when you are hyping a new film. The paparazzi does not focus on your social life and you stay away from Twitter, Facebook and MySpace and don't understand why someone would want to be tracked down 24 hours a day."

      name: You are like Tobey Maguire and Helen Mirren
      recommendation: "You Prefer to Fly Under the Radar: You are most like Tobey Maguire, Sean Penn, Jennifer Garner and Helen Mirren wrapped up into one.When not filming or promoting a blockbuster movie, you rarely appear in the public eye or press. Your identity as a celebrity is tied only to your performances. You prefer to lead a quiet life with your family and react adversely to the intrusion of photographers. All in all, you tend to fly under the radar and raise little controversy.When pushed, you are fiercely private about your personal life and may become aggressive in your defense of it. You tend to lash out when your space is invaded. However, despite holding a close hand concerning your life behind the scenes, you tend to be quite outspoken about your political and/or social interests. A fine line is drawn-one often only clear to you--between the personal and the political.Though recognized everywhere you go, you generally avoid the press unless promoting a movie or appearing on the red carpet with your significant other. You strive to maintain your privacy and live a normal life, despite the hounding of photographers. Selling your personal photos to magazines or tabloids is not an option. Sometimes the paparazzi get too close, but you keep your poise and avoid confrontation.In the end you always show up at an awards show prepared and ready to take the best actor award home with you. The roles you prefer are period pieces where your character transforms back to another era, time and dress."
