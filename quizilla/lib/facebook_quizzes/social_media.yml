      name: "You're addicted to social media!"
      recommendation: "You may need to tear yourself away from the computer screen You love to be tuned into what's going on at all times. Whether it's at your PC or on your smartphone, you have a network of friends on various social sites that you like to keep informed about what they're doing, and inform others about your activities. Wherever you are, your smartphone is right there with you. To you, social media is the fastest and most effective way for your communicate with friends. Still, don't forget about sitting down with friends, away from the machines and unplug at least once a week. Also, don't let all that time you're spending with your nose in your phone stress you out! By constantly being \"tuned in\"; and checking messages and statuses all day you can miss the chance to unwind away from the screens! Life is all about balance."

      name: You keep social media in perspective
      recommendation: "You balance real life with your second life You enjoy keeping in touch with faraway relatives and friends on the internet. You think it's great that you can see how your high school friends are doing even though you haven't seen them in over 20 years. But you also keep your relationships offline first and foremost. You recognize that it can be alienating to people when you check your phone constantly throughout a meal together, and you're aware of other people's feelings. You are social and get together with friends as often as you can and you share quality time you all deserve. To you, social media is great and it helps make communication with friends easy when face-to-face interactions are not possible."

      name: You should explore the world of social media
      recommendation: "An old friend is waiting for you When it comes to social media, you are missing out. Whether it's finding old friends on Facebook or putting your resume on Linkedin, you'll find social media as an effective communication tool. You pride yourself on your people skills and the strong relationships you've built in business and in your personal life, but today's world can keep you on top of the fun at the touch of a button! Have you ever thought about a childhood friend who moved away and wondered \"whatever happened to...\"? Go out and find them online. Think how great it would be to catch up! No one is saying you have to drop everything to stay tuned via social media, but don't get caught in a rut.  Life is all about constantly experiencing new things and it's easier today than ever."
