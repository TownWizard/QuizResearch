  quiz_photo_path: "Victorias_Secret_Model.jpg"
  description: "Maybe you dream about looking like them, or going out on a date with them â€“ but when it comes to the Victoria's Secret Angels, they're all unique and no two are alike. But do you identify more with a German glamazon or the former of next year's \"Top Model\"?"

      name: "You're Tyra Banks"
      recommendation: "You have the brassiness and big personality of Tyra Banks! You've put your modeling career behind you, but no one can forget you: Sometimes it's as if your voice and opinions enter a room before you do. Be loud on behalf of those who can't and hear the power of your stance; don't cave to those that would silence you.  Know when to indulge yourself and when to push a little harder: the good life lies in between home-cooked meals and sweat sessions, and red-carpet events and charity catwalks. And through it all, don't be afraid to admit when you're wrong-we all are sometimes."

      name: "You're Gisele Bundchen"
      recommendation: "Even though you're super-successful at what you do, like angel Gisele Bundchen, most people know you now from the gossip going around. Shake them off and embrace your fabulous life, because no one's going to do it for you. Just as Gisele's priorities have shifted as she adjusts to life with husband Tom Brady and child, you would do well to consider that your time is going where you want it to. Invest in a planner or make a good to-do list over coffee every day, so you know the most important things in your life will get done. But don't get so bogged-down in the day-to-day that you forget to think about what happens next: Why not visit a psychic or read a mind-opening book? You may find out something about yourself that surprises you."

      name: "You're Heidi Klum"
      recommendation: "She memorably said \"In fashion, one day you're in - the next day you're out\" - but if you're like Heidi Klum, you're never out. You balance work and play with such elegance; your parties are legendary, but you work the room to build up your successful business. You're not just a party girl! You always seem so sunny but with a core of steel. Hold your head up and celebrate your accomplishments both professional and personal. Showcase your years of experience in fashion by picking out a standout spring piece, even if it's a little brighter than you normally would; don't hide in basic black. And continue to make time for your loved ones; as much as you may go out, they're the ones who make it worth coming home."
