      name: "It's your way or the highway!"
      recommendation: "You are a drill sergeant: You like to keep control in your life - both at home and in your workplace. That is admirable, and you are probably a pro at keeping many balls in the air at once. But a drill sergeant can be tough to deal with on a daily basis, and sometimes situations call for flexibility. You may be taking on too much and feel that the only way to get it all done is to bark orders and delegate to underlings. But you need to stop pushing people around. Your way is not always the right way and you should be thoughtful of people around you. Next time you find yourself speaking in a firm, bossy tone, stop and take a deep breath. If possible, walk away from the situation to get a minute to compose yourself. Sometimes the old saying about catching more flies with honey than vinegar is true; kindness begets kindness and you may find yourself getting more things accomplished and feeling better about yourself when you are flexible. Other people will respond positively to your change as well."

      name: "You are easy-going but get things done! "
      recommendation: "You are efficient and keep people happy: You seem to have gotten the right balance between being a team player and sticking up for yourself. Good for you! People sometimes fall into a routine of taking on too much simply because it's 'easier', or they don't want to rock the boat. But, in the long run, it doesn't benefit anyone: the 'taker' doesn&rsquo;t learn to do things for themselves, and the 'giver' gets resentful because they are doing too much. Continue to look for areas in your life-whether it's at work or at home-to help people out while at the same time being true to yourself and knowing how much is too much."

    quiz_recommendation_2:
      name: You might be a pushover
      recommendation: "Don't make everyone happy at your expense: You yearn to be a crowd pleaser and to be liked by everyone. You want to make everyone else happy and don't like to make waves. But you have to work on not being a pushover. You have to learn to say the word, 'no'. People may balk at first, particularly family members and co-workers who have gotten used to dumping things on you and you getting them done. But they can get used to the new you, too. You will have more time for yourself, will definitely feel less stressed, and you may just gain the respect of some people who have been using you for too long. You need to stop trying to be what everyone else wants you to be. It is time you realize that you don't need to do everything according to everyone else's wish to get people's affections.  Put things in perspective and think about your needs too. Don't be afraid to make your voice heard! In the long run, those people who love you for who you are and not for what you do for them will stay by your side."
