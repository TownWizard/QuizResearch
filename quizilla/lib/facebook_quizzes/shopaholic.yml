      name: "You are a Shopaholic"
      recommendation: "You are a Shopaholic: You may be a shopaholic! Do you find yourself canceling plans with friends because there's a sale at your favorite department store? Are you finding it hard to make the minimum payments on your credit cards each month? Shopping is fun, and having new clothing and housewares is great, but you have to ask yourself if you're shopping for the right reasons. Maybe you're bored. Consider joining a local social group in your town to meet new people and cultivate new hobbies. Try to increase your exercise levels. For some people, acquiring new items gives raises their spirits; exercise can produce that same release of endorphins responsible for the \"rush.\" Quitting shopping cold turkey can be impossible for some people, but here is an idea to try. If you see something you must have, make yourself wait a day. Ask the store if they can put it on hold for you. Go home and sleep on it. If you absolutely still want the item the next day, return to the store and buy it. This \"slowing down\" will force you to put more thought into your purchases."

      recommendation: "You are an Online shopper: You've embraced the technology of the new millennium -- well, at least as far as shopping is concerned. No longer a slave to crowded mall parking lots, you consider shipping costs more reasonable than paying for gas and tolls to get to the shopping center. You've even tried a shop-at-home grocery website, though you think they need to work out a few more kinks in their produce and frozen foods delivery. You love coming home from work to see what the mailman has dropped off for you. Since you've discovered trying on clothing purchases in the comfort of your own home, you avoid stores as much as possible nowadays."
