                  <blurb>&lt;p&gt;Good job keeping your weight where you want it. That&amp;rsquo;s not easy. If you manage your weight with a healthy, well-balanced diet&amp;mdash;particularly if it&amp;rsquo;s rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, and other whole foods&amp;mdash;you should feel very good about yourself. But if you keep your weight down with less-than-ideal eating habits, you may compromise your health by missing nutrients your body needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your eating habits, most of us can do a little better by learning more about healthy nutrition, addressing issues that cause us to eat poorly, or finding ways to be less rigid about eating perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personalized Plan you receive when you join the MaxWell Daily Club will include ideas for healthy eating to satisfy your body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</blurb>
